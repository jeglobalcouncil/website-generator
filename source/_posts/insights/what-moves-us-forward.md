**In 1967, the first Junior Enterprise was born in France.** Aiming to learn beyond what was seen in class, a student-run non profit organization was created to solve real market problems, through projects for clients that varied from big companies to solo entrepreneurs.

**Today, we have 980+ Junior Enterprises in 44 countries, summing more than 50 thousand Junior Entrepreneurs.** And we are probably the only student movement to achieve these numbers in a bottom-up manner: most of all, it was the collaboration within our network that got us where we are today.

**But we have to remember: there is still much more to do.** There is still a gap between the university and the job market, entrepreneurship abilities that students need to develop and demand from the market for affordable high-quality projects. And these aren’t local problems. They are problems faced globally, for generations, in a variety of fields. That’s why it is so important for our movement to become truly global, and for every instance of it to keep improving.

**Two years ago, we took a step in this direction.** During JEWC (Junior Enterprise World Conference) 2016, the JE Global Council was created with a clear objective: guarantee the enlargement and alignment of the Junior Enterprise concept throughout the world.

**Now, we need to make the next chapters of this story happen.** Through collaboration, through partnerships with our stakeholders, through our projects and actions, we to turn all your successes, big or small, into micro-revolutions, changing our world today and ensuring we are all committed and capable to solve the problems of tomorrow. Being a junior entrepreneur is just our first step.
