The Junior Enterprise Movement is following many steps to become more global. But one thing to consider when working together is the understanding of the educational, economic and cultural diversity of each country.

**It is important to know the context of the network around the world, so that we can be united by our differences and enrich our movement.**

During the Junior Enterprise Global Forum 2018, in Lyon, our national confederations had the chance to present themselves and their latest achievements.

Now, we’re sharing highlights from these presentations with you!

#### Brazil

In 2016, Brazil adopted a new **network strategy** with a **clear set of goals shared between all JEs**. This strategy stimulated impressive growth in the number of JEs AND in the results of each JE. From 315 organizations in 2016, there are now 650+ recognized JEs in the country and it is expected that all 27 Brazilian states will be federated by the end of the year.

Moreover, to accelerate recognition and growth, the Brazilian Confederation – [Brasil Júnior](https://brasiljunior.org.br/) – has delivered projects like the [“Entrepreneurial Universities Index”](http://brasiljunior.rds.land/indice2017) and the [“Hire a JE” Platform](https://contrateumaempresajunior.com.br/).

#### France

Home of the oldest and largest JEs in the world, France has 185 JEs, spread across all regions of the country and totalling 21 500+ junior entrepreneurs. By 2020, they envision reaching **25 000+ students**.

[The French Confederation – CNJE](https://junior-entreprises.com/) – is the leader among all confederations in obtaining sponsorships to support their activities and events. Their articulation with the public sector is equally strong: last year they achieved special accreditation for JEs in relation to certain types of French taxes.

#### Tunisia

Between 2012 (when [JET, the Tunisian Confederation](http://jetunisie.com/), was founded) and 2016, Tunisia saw a growth of around **8x** in the numbers of JEs. The network soon observed the importance of having JEs with better results, and the junior entrepreneurs started to deliver: Between 2016 and 2017 there was a **5x** growth in the revenue of the Tunisian network!

To strengthen their network, one of JET’s tools has been their events. The events are tailored to help junior entrepreneurs in the **different steps of their journey**, from the first day in their JE all the way to reaching a leadership role.

#### Morocco

[The Moroccan Confederation (CJEM)](http://www.cjem.ma/) represents 8 JEs in the country. **But this number might increase quickly** since they are giving support to 9 initiatives.

Furthermore, they are [organizing a caravan](https://lematin.ma/journal/2018/cjem-lance-caravane-africaine/298397.html) to promote the creation and development of Junior Enterprises in many other countries in the African continent. Hopefully, their work will bring great outcomes for the JE Movement!

#### United States

The Confederation of the United States of America – [JE USA](https://www.juniorenterprise.us/) – recognizes that its annual national event, the [JE USA Summit](https://www.juniorenterprise.us/2018-je-usa-summit/), can have a huge impact in their network. After all, the event is when they align their JEurs towards common goals.

It is also open to non-junior entrepreneurs, which may later become the **creators of new JEs**. And lastly, it is an opportunity for **international integration**: JEurs from Canada, Mexico and around the world are equally invited.

#### Canada & Switzerland

For these two countries, their latest achievement was **accepting a challenge**: To create JEs in new regions, despite significant barriers.

For [JC3, the Canadian Confederation](http://jc3.ca/en), there is a distance barrier: Canada is a country with a continental size and most JEs so far have been concentrated in the eastern province of Quebec.

As for [JADE Switzerland](http://www.jadeswitzerland.ch/), the Swiss Confederation, there is a language barrier: Four languages are spoken in the country (Italian, French, German and Romansh) and most JEs so far are from the French speaking regions.

#### Cameroon

The [Confederation of JEs in Cameroon (JECam)](https://www.facebook.com/juniorentreprisecameroun/) already has a good network of JEs in Yaoundé and Douala. Through the JE experience, students are growing, connecting, and going on to create their own businesses, which is also helping broadcast the JE concept in the country.

To develop their junior entrepreneurs, the confederation has started a **formations programme**, with trainings scheduled about several topics important to the activities of a JE.

#### Germany

Germany is the only country with two independent confederations: [BDSU](https://bdsu.de/) and [JCNetwork](https://www.jcnetwork.de/home/). Despite having their own approaches, both confederations are constantly working together as partners in order to promote the JE concept and this collaboration has gotten very strong this year.

Representing together a network of over **4000 students**, they work to expand the network, to find partnerships and they are constantly inviting each other for events **to promote the sharing of ideas** among all German JEs.

#### Norway

The latest addition to the Global JE network, Norway has the achievement of joining the network through [StudConsult](https://www.studconsult.no/), which was admitted last month as a new consultative member within JADE.

#### Portugal & United Kingdom

The first country has a Confederation – [JADE Portugal](https://www.jadeportugal.pt/) – whilst the second is represented within JADE by a Consultative Member: [WBC](http://www.wbc-uk.com/). But these two countries have something big in common: They’ve been selected to host the **next main events** of the European JE network.

WBC is hosting the [JADE Autumn Conference](https://www.facebook.com/JadeAutumnConference2018/) in November in London. And JADE Portugal will host next year, through one of its JEs, the [Summer JADE Conference](https://www.facebook.com/iscacjuniorsolutions/photos/a.268790073223462/1372347999534325/?type=3) in Coimbra.

With all the exciting developments in the European network, these events are bound to be amazing!

#### Europe

Finally, on Europe, [JADE](http://www.jadenet.org/) works as an **umbrella confederation**, bringing together 15 countries with national confederations or consultative members (Austria, Belgium, Croatia, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland & UK).

What’s incredible is that all of these countries have a pretty big achievement to share: They’ve signed last month **their first ever network strategy**, which has been nicknamed the **Agreement of Lyon**.

As part of this strategy, all of these countries have committed together to, until 2021:

* Become 500 JEs _(52% growth from their current number of JEs!)_
* Execute 5750 projects per year _(versus 4350 projects this year)_
* And ensure that 300 of these projects are collaborative: executed by two or more JEs working in partnership.

With this, you can rest assured that these will be priorities for all the 15 European countries in the JE network.

#### Conclusion

This article cannot describe all the details or the richness of the JE movement around the world, but having a general view is a great first step. All the confederations of our global network are committed, with common goals and keen to collaborate to achieve them.

The future is global and we are ready to fight for it.
