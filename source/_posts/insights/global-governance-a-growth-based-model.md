_"All the models are wrong. Some are useful." George E P Box_

It is with this phrase that the Junior Enterprise Global Council and its 8 member Confederations began to rethink the organization's decision-making system.

The need for this renewal originated through clear challenges, which can be summarized by these questions:

> _How will we be in 2030?
> Is the current model sustainable? It's fair? Does it encompass all the major agents?
> How will we organize ourselves with not only 8 but with 20 Confederations? And 50? 100?
> What is the complexity of a global governance?
> _

With this in mind, during 2018 and having concluded at the 3rd Junior Enterprise Global Forum in Lyon, the corporate governance project of the JE Global Council was done in a **collaborative way** with several layers of the Board: Council Board, Executive Board, Executive Team, Advisory Board and several Alumni of the global network.

Thus, with inspiration from the United Nations itself, a model based on** decision-making groups** and **transfer of representation** was established, in order to facilitate transparency, equity and follow-up of global projects.

#### Here are the elements of our new Governance Model

* **General Assembly: **Maximum decision-making body, composed by all of the Confederations that are members of the Global Council. Here the votes are weighted by the number of Junior Enterprises in each Confederations and decisions are related to the network as a whole and work at a macro-level. Each year, the General Assembly will meet at the Global Forum to bring together the leaders of the network and make the most important decisions of the cycle.

**PS:** It is important to emphasize the novelty in this aspect, in which each National Confederation of Europe has become part of the Global Council, which made us go **from 8 to 18 Confederations **composing the general assembly!

* **Council Board:** Intermediate decision-making body, in which 3 Confederations will be elected by the General Assembly to represent it in the closest follow-up to the Executive Board of the Global Council. With 1 vote each, these confederations will have more specific and operational decisions, such as finances, goals and project monitoring, meeting periodically with the Global Council.
* **Observers:** Invited countries, which are in the process of establishing a Confederation or joining the Global Council. While not having decisions to make, they are extremely important for a more general view of our network, as well as the very engagement of these countries within the Global Council.
* **Executive Board:** Executing body, responsible for the leadership of the Executive Team and being represented by its Secretary General, the bridge between the different layers of the organization.

We believe the model is useful, an important step for the Global Council, and more than that, will play a key role in the intended outcomes for the future of the Global Network, mainly related to Global Growth.

What we _learned in this process?_ There were three things:

1. Copying what works right may be the solution! _Why re-invent the wheel?_
2. If growing is a problem for the structure, _change its structure to grow even more!_
3. And last but not least: **None of us are as strong as all of us together!** Being able to finally have Europe with us and new countries more and more present was certainly a victory!
