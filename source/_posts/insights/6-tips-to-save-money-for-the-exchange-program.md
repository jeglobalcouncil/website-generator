In the [Exchange Program](https://exchange.juniorenterprises.org/), while you get free hosting in the house of a Junior Entrepreneur, you are responsible for the other travel costs. If you’re going to work for a JE in a nearby country, these costs are smaller, but if you’re going to another continent, the costs could add up.

To help make your journey more accessible, we compiled below a few tricks and tips that past participants used to save for their Exchange!

**PS: If you don’t know much about the Exchange Program yet, **[**click here to check out the hotsite**](https://exchange.juniorenterprises.org/)** and discover everything about it!**

#### 1.	Sponsorship from your JE

It is quite important for your junior enterprise to establish contact with JEs in another country and you can look for a small sponsorship by talking to the ExBo or preparing a presentation (check out this [article](https://juniorenterprises.org/insights/5-reasons-why-you-should-participate-in-the-exchange-program/) for some convincing reasons!)

#### 2.	Sell Raffle Tickets

It is one of the fastest and simplest ways of raising money, but still quite useful. By organising a raffle you can also improve your selling skills and raise money for this experience.

#### 3.	Sell Something You Do

Are you good in editing videos, teaching math, translating, making craft-work? Now you have the chance to use these abilities as well as your personal marketing in order to raise the money you need to travel! Maybe you can even discover a new ability in the process.

#### 4.	Get Cheaper Flights

The flight is one of the more expensive parts of the trip. But depending on the destination, buying multiple flights separately can decrease the price a lot (sometimes even by half). You just need to pay attention to the time between and grab the baggage. Flights in the middle of the week also tend to be cheaper.

#### 5.	Cheaper Health Insurances

Did you know you can find health insurance discount codes only by searching in Google? Many companies offer these discounts for the whole world and you can get it by typing: “_insurance name_ discount code” in Google. Besides that, comparing the different ones is also a good way to find the best option for you.

#### 6.	Invite your Friends

We have special discounts on the participation fee of the Exchange Program for members of JEs: **1)** that will have more than one member travelling in this edition, **2)** that participated as a host JE in a prior edition OR** 3)** that will participate as a host in this edition of the program.
