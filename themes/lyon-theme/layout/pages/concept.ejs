      <div class="vertical card">
        <h4>Purpose-driven</h4>
        <p>JEs focus on their purpose of providing services to clients and fostering members' development.</p>
        <p>This focus turns them into labs to develop skills and makes them organize themselves in increasingly innovative ways.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="vertical card">
        <h4>High-growth</h4>
        <p>To truly foster members' development, JEs challenge themselves to improve every year.</p>
        <p>This understanding keeps pushing them to increase the impact, quality and numbers of their projects.</p>
        <p></p>
      </div>
      <div class="vertical card">
        <h4>Interconnected</h4>
        <p>Junior Enterprises work under the guidance of teachers, learn from professionals and share knowledge with other JEs.</p>
        <p>In everything they do, they work as an active part of a network.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="vertical card">
        <h4>Generators of Impact</h4>
        <p>JEs improve employability of students and make them 2x more likely to be entrepreneurs.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
