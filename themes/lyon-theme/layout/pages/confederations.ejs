    <h3>What is a confederation?</h3>
    <p>Confederations are umbrella organizations of Junior Enterprises in a given country or region.</p>
    <p>They not only represent and support their JEs, but also work for the enlargement of the <a href="/concept">JE Concept</a> in their region.</p>
    <p>If you are interested in creating a new Junior Enterprise in a country that already has a confederation, you can contact them for help, as they will be ready to aid you in this journey!</p>

    <h3>The network</h3>
    <p>The following confederations are part of the <a href="/global-council">Junior Enterprise Global Council</a>:</p>
    <div class="deck">
      <% site.posts.forEach(function(confederation){ %>
        <% if(confederation.type=='confederation' || confederation.type=='jade-member'){ %>
          <%- partial('partial/confederation-card', { confederation: confederation }) %>

    <p>Among the members above, JADE Europe is unique because it is an umbrella confederation of all the national confederations in Europe. Because of this, JADE Europe is not part of the Global Council's General Assembly, but can have a <a href="/insights/global-governance-a-growth-based-model/">Council Board</a> position, representing all of Europe in it.</p>
    <p>Inside JADE, the following countries are consultative members and are thus also represented in the JE Global Council through JADE Europe:</p>
